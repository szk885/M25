## Model Description for Logistic Regression and SVC

### Logistic Regression

**Input:** 
- Features: 'open-close', 'low-high', 'is_quarter_end'
- Target: 'target' (binary classification)

**Output:** 
- Binary classification predictions (0 or 1)

**Model Architecture:** 
- Logistic Regression is a linear classification model that uses a logistic function to model the probability of a binary outcome. It estimates the coefficients for each feature and combines them linearly to make predictions.

### Performance
- Training AUC: 0.552189
- Validation AUC: 0.545759
- Data: NIO stock data (1980 samples)

**Performance Metrics:**
- ROC AUC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve)

**Performance Summary:**
- The Logistic Regression model achieved an AUC of 0.552189 on the training data and 0.545759 on the validation data, indicating modest predictive power.

### Limitations
- Logistic Regression assumes that the relationship between features and the log-odds of the target is linear, which may not be the case for complex datasets.
- It may not capture non-linear relationships in the data effectively.

### Trade-offs
- Logistic Regression is interpretable and computationally efficient but may underperform when the data has complex, non-linear patterns.

### Support Vector Classifier (SVC)

**Input:** 
- Features: 'open-close', 'low-high', 'is_quarter_end'
- Target: 'target' (binary classification)

**Output:** 
- Binary classification predictions (0 or 1)

**Model Architecture:** 
- Support Vector Classifier (SVC) is a supervised machine learning algorithm that attempts to find a hyperplane that best separates the data into two classes. It can use different kernel functions to map data into higher dimensions.

### Performance
- Training AUC: 0.529776
- Validation AUC: 0.55697
- Data: NIO stock data (1980 samples)

**Performance Metrics:**
- ROC AUC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve)

**Performance Summary:**
- The SVC model with a linear kernel achieved an AUC of 0.529776 on the training data and 0.55697 on the validation data.

### Limitations
- SVC's performance can be sensitive to the choice of kernel and hyperparameters.
- May not perform well on large datasets due to high computational complexity.

### Trade-offs
- SVC can handle non-linear data when appropriate kernel functions are chosen but may require careful hyperparameter tuning.
- Linear SVC is computationally efficient and interpretable.
